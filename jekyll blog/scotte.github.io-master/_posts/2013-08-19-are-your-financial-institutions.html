    If so, you are lucky - because mine sure aren't. Seems like
    every bank or other financial institution that I do business
    with is about a decade or so behind in web technology. They
    have very, very long and infrequent software development
    cycles, don't support recent (much less latest) client
    technologies, and have "major new feature releases" that are
    pretty darn uninspiring.<br>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      I can understand the importance of moving slow when it comes
      to people's finances, but it seems they don't really have a
      distinction between basic usability and those things that
      could result in serious financial exposure. In these days of
      distributed systems there's no excuse to muddle UIs with the
      backend.<br>

      <div>
        <br>
      </div>

      <div>
        I have three quick stories from the last year or so across
        two different financial institutions. They will remain
        nameless, although one of them (which comprises the first
        two stories) I'm in the process of closing accounts down,
        and in the third I have a great personal relationship with
        individual people - and even though their technology is
        pretty bad, the institution itself is excellent.
      </div>

      <div>
        <br>
      </div>

      <h2>Story #1 - Please Downgrade Your Browser</h2>

      <div>
        So I've been using the institution's website several times
        a week with no problem, then suddenly it stops working from
        Chrome - I was unable to login, it would just redirect me
        to the login page. Maybe Chrome updated, I'm not really
        sure (my Linux distribution handles updates so well I
        seldom pay any attention into what get's updated). So, I
        try Firefox&nbsp;and it works fine, I am able to login to
        my account, so I fire off an email to customer support to
        let them know Chrome 17 (this is May 2012) doesn't work
        with their site. Following is the response:
      </div>

      <div>
        <br>
      </div><span style=
      "color: cyan; font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">I
      apologize that you have encountered this difficulty.
      Unfortunately, higher versions of chrome are unsupported with
      our website. When a browser version is unsupported the
      functionality will be intermittent at best. Sometimes it will
      work fine for months, and then one day stop working all
      together.<br>
      <br>
      In order to continue using Chrome without issue, please use
      one of the following supported versions:<br>
      <br>
      &Acirc;&middot; Chrome: Versions 11 or 12<br>
      <br>
      Once again, I do apologize for any inconvenience this may
      have caused. We are continually working on updating our
      supported browsers, but at this time those are the only truly
      supported versions.</span>
    </div>

    <div>
      <span style=
      "font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br></span>

      <div>
        Realize that the institution's website doesn't do anything
        complex - absolutely nothing that an update from Chrome 16
        to 17 should cause inability to login. It's only because of
        using non-w3c compliant practices that this would happen in
        the first place, but it's absolute madness to suggest I
        would downgrade back 5 or 6 versions of Chrome! I'm not
        even sure how I would do that, does Google even have
        archives where you can download old versions?
      </div>

      <div>
        <br>
      </div>

      <div>
        At least they didn't tell me to use IE. That's the response
        I've gotten from a number of customer support interactions
        for various things over the years, even after telling them
        I'm not on Windows.
      </div>

      <div>
        <br>
      </div>

      <div>
        I don't remember how long it was before I could use the
        site again in Chrome, but it was at least several months,
        and I received no notification or follow-up, I just tried
        one day and it worked.
      </div>

      <div>
        <br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <b><span style="color: orange;">How would a more modern
        site deal with this? First of all, they would be testing
        not only the latest stable versions of browsers, but the
        bleeding edge, and be prepared. They would also be agile
        with the ability to test and push new releases daily, not
        monthly, to resolve fundamental usability issues. Good
        customer support would also dictate closing the loop with
        the customer, rather than leaving them hanging.</span></b>

      <div>
        <b><br></b>
      </div>

      <h2>Story #2 - We Will Resolve This In 48 Hours</h2>

      <div>
        My paycheck was deposited into one institution, then
        partially transferred to another institution (the one in
        story #1) via an inter-bank ACH transfer initiated by the
        second institution. This had been working fine for a couple
        of years, then one day my transfer doesn't go through. Did
        they notify me of the failure? Nope. Did the account
        transfer page show anything interesting? Nope - the
        transfer just disappeared, unlike past transfers which had
        a history, it just vanished - like it never happened.
      </div>

      <div>
        <br>
      </div>

      <div>
        So, being the reasonable person that I am, I called
        customer service and opened a ticket with them. They said
        they would look into it, and it should be resolved in 48
        hours. One month later they resolved the issue. You read
        that right, it took a month for their 48 hour fix. For the
        first 3 weeks I called them several times a week for a
        status, and their answer was always 48 hours - even after
        we were in this situation for 3 weeks. All they would tell
        me is that they were "investigating the issue" and that it
        would be resolved soon. Not knowing what was happening, and
        assuming that they would get the transfer through "real
        soon now" we ended up going low on funds in that
        institution and were basically unable to use our account.
        If I had known it would be weeks I would have deposited via
        other means, but when I'm told it's only a couple of days
        because they are nearly done with the fix I guess I was
        overly optimistic. To make matters worse, when I was
        concerned about automatic, scheduled payments, they told me
        there wouldn't be a problem because the problem was on
        their end - fool me once, shame on you... It was a problem
        because those payments still went through, even though they
        told me all was fine. As it turns out, they finally
        admitted it was a software bug in their ACH system, but for
        this institution it was too late as we had already taken
        our banking elsewhere.
      </div>

      <div>
        <b><span style="color: orange;">How would a more modern
        company deal with this? This isn't strictly a site issue,
        but it was a back-end software problem, and repeatedly
        telling me it would be resolved in 2 days when in fact it
        would take 30 did nothing to help. I'm sure they didn't
        actually know, but better to give the customer a
        pessimistic answer than an
        unreasonably&nbsp;optimistic&nbsp;one. I arranged my
        finances based on what they told me and would have reacted
        completely differently otherwise. Additionally, I had to
        keep calling them for status, as they would never call me
        back after the promised 48 hours. They finally did call me
        back when it resolved, but by then it didn't matter
        anymore.</span></b>

      <h2>Story #3 - &nbsp;We Are Experiencing Known Performance
      Issues</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
      On a Saturday morning I logged into my account at this
      institution to check some activity. At least, that's what I
      was trying to do - the institution's landing page didn't
      mention a thing, and it was only after logging in that they
      displayed a page that the site was down for maintenance for
      the whole weekend.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      Really? Down for the whole weekend for an upgrade? This is
      2013! &nbsp;And with zero notification in advance that the
      site would be down (they have my email address). And I had to
      login to even find out.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      The last couple of companies I've worked at have prided
      themselves on the ability to do live rolling upgrades with no
      site outage. This is not a hard thing to do these days with a
      good architecture. Being down for 2 days would mean going out
      of business for a lot of places, but for a financial
      institution it's considered normal, I guess.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      OK great, so now it's Monday morning and I try to login
      again. Right, so the page times out. I reload, and after
      several minutes, I finally get a page. Clicking on anything
      results in a similar pattern - either a timeout or page load
      time of several minutes. I tried to use the online feedback
      form, but that timed out too.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      A call to customer service resulted in a long wait time with
      a message that they were aware of site performance issues due
      to huge demand for the upgraded site. I guess that's one way
      to put it, but clearly they did insufficient testing and
      weren't ready for Monday morning. There was no reason for me
      to waste support's time at that point, so I hung up and tried
      to login again later.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      How great was the new site? It sucks just as bad as the old
      one did. It's really pretty bad.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      <b><span style="color: orange;">How would a more agile
      company deal with this? They would test things in advance, do
      rolling updates rather than having a site outage for 2+ days,
      and route just a portion of traffic to the new site until
      being comfortable that all is well prior to a full
      cut-over.</span></b>
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      What's the lesson from all of this? Financial institution IT
      is well behind the times and could learn a lot of things from
      agile companies who release continually. Again, I understand
      the financial risk, but a good architecture would insulate
      those details from the website and it's usability for
      customers.
