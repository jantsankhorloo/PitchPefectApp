    The title for this post is a quote from a well reading
    interview with Richard Posner, the judge who presided over the
    Apple vs Motorola suit, and ultimately threw out the
    lawsuit:<br>
    <br>
    <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/05/us-apple-google-judge-idUSBRE8640IQ20120705">http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/05/us-apple-google-judge-idUSBRE8640IQ20120705</a>
    <br>
    It won't be a surprise to anyone reading this that I agree with
    Mr. Posner. The current US patent system is broken, especially
    when it comes to software and our modern selection of
    computers, tablets, phones, and other software-driven
    devices.<br>
    <br>
    It's time for companies to win because it's what people want
    and are buying, not because of lawsuits. Competition is good
    for the industry, and the differences between competitors are
    pretty small these days. We are past the point of "invention" -
    at this point it's all refinement and innovation, and let's let
    that battle happen in the marketplace, not the court room.
