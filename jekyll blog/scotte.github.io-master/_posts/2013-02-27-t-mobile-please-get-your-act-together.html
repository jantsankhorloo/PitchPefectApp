    I'll start by saying <b>yes</b>, this is a moderately whiny
    complaint blog. But if it helps one other person, then it's
    worth it.<br>
    <br>
    <b>T-Mobile has a great $30 pre-pay plan - unlimited text,
    unlimited data, 100 minutes talk</b>. For our usage, this plan
    is perfect and pretty darn cheap. Sure, the "unlimited" data
    means that overage happens at a lower speed, but we've never
    come close to that limit.<br>
    <br>
    Because this plan is such a good fit for people who don't use
    their phones as phones much, this is a great plan. However as
    far as I can figure out, T-Mobile doesn't want anyone to
    actually use this plan. It's easy, when you know the tricks,
    but forget trying to get T-Mobile to help you get this plan.
    Their customer support can't get you this plan (and will even
    go so far as to not tell the truth, insisting that you have to
    buy a new phone at Walmart). With the information in this post,
    you'll learn how to activate this plan and save a ton of
    money.<br>
    <br>
    I've been a generally happy T-Mobile customer for a 8 years
    now, and I've had up to 4 lines on the account, though for the
    last 2 years we've had 2 pre-pay and 1 post-pay. The sole
    post-pay has been my Android phone, with the 2 pre-pay being
    feature phones used by other members of the family. You'd think
    that being a good customer in good standing for a long time
    would matter, but alas, in today's business world, it doesn't -
    they really just don't care.<br>
    <br>
    In the last 9 months or so I've gone through a spree of
    updating my Android phone from a Samsung Galaxy 1, then a
    Samsung Galaxy 2, and now a Nexus 4. I've had a 2 year contract
    (which just expired), but swapped the phones around under the
    contract without even notifying T-Mobile. I bought the Galaxy 2
    off a coworker, and the Nexus 4 straight from Google, so
    T-Mobile wasn't involved in the purchase of any device aside
    from the Galaxy 1 that I used when I started my 2 year
    contract.<br>
    <br>
    I had to do some hacking to cut the regular SIM card down to
    microSIM for the Nexus 4, but that turned out to be really easy
    with some guidance from a coworker who had already done the
    same thing. Seriously, it's really easy to make a microSIM.
    Don't pay T-Mobile $50 for a replacement SIM, just grab some
    scissors and do it for free. You've got nothing to lose, and if
    you screw it up (but you won't, it's easy), then you can still
    pay T-Mobile for a replacement SIM. Don't buy a SIM cutter,
    don't buy a cutting pattern, just find someone with another
    microSIM so you get the outline right, cut it a bit big, and
    trim to size. If I can do it, you can do it.<br>
    <br>
    When I bought the Galaxy 2, I sold my Galaxy 1 to a friend of
    mine. But when I bought the Nexus 4, I gave my wife the Galaxy
    2 as an upgrade to her feature phone. The $30 pre-pay plan was
    appealing, so I bought a SIM card for $1 from the T-Mobile
    online store. It came a few days later, I activated it under a
    new number, with no problem, then called T-Mobile's
    <i>horrible</i>&nbsp;offshore pre-pay customer service to
    cancel her old number and transfer this number to the new
    number. <b>This is really important:</b> <i>Do not, under any
    circumstances, attempt to activate the plan or SIM via T-Mobile
    customer service. They cannot and will not help you. You need
    to buy a SIM online and activate it online, then only call
    customer service to port your number afterwards.</i><br>
    <br>
    Fast forward a few weeks until my 2-year post-pay contract is
    up. I wanted to switch my phone to the same $30 pre-pay plan. I
    know the plan works, because my wife has been using it for a
    few weeks, but unlike her plan where we were converting pre-pay
    to pre-pay, I was converting post-pay to pre-pay. Cancelling
    post-pay requires a conversation with customer service, but I
    thought it would be easy - and it is, now that I know the
    secret, but boy did I go about it the wrong way (by trying to
    go about it the right way)!<br>
    <br>
    My initial plan was to call up post-pay and cancel. Then I
    would buy a pre-pay SIM for $1 from the online store, activate
    it, and just like with the Galaxy 2, be set and done with this.
    Sounds simple, right?<br>
    <br>
    So I called up post-pay customer service and told them I wanted
    to cancel. I get an amazingly awesome CSR (customer service
    rep), who first tells me he can get my current $79 plan for
    $55. This is a decent discount, but $55 is obviously more than
    $30, so I told him what I planned to do - that I was going to
    cancel, and just reactivate with a pre-pay SIM. He agreed with
    me that requiring customers to cancel just to activate pre-pay
    was silly, and he said he could override pre-pay and give me
    the $30 plan I wanted. Pretty awesome, right?! So, the guy sets
    me up and says I'll get an SMS within 24 hours, and that I'll
    need to then go activate with that code to switch to
    pre-pay.<br>
    <br>
    I can't say enough good things about this post-pay CSR who
    helped me. Unlike every pre-pay CSR, and most other post-pay
    CSRs, he really wanted to help me - and understood that
    ultimately the end state would be the plan I wanted, so
    T-Mobile might as well make it easy on everyone involved and
    just do it.<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, it didn't quite work out that way - pre-pay
    denied the account conversion. Of course they couldn't be
    bothered to actually call me, or notify me - instead they just
    blocked the conversion silently. Two days later I called, as I
    hadn't received the SMS to activate the new plan. This is where
    things got ugly. Post-pay wouldn't help me, and transferred me
    to pre-pay. Pre-pay told me that I couldn't get this plan and
    that it was only available if you bought a new phone from
    Walmart (<b>This is obviously untrue, and a total lie on
    T-Mobile's part, as I had activated this exact same plan
    previously with the Galaxy 2!</b>). I got really angry with the
    pre-pay CSR, who just started to give me a bunch of run-around.
    Asking me for account and SIM card numbers (which I never
    needed before), and finally just refusing to help me, even when
    provided with this information as well as the confirmation
    reference from my call two days previous. I asked, several
    times, to just transfer me to someone who could help me, but
    she basically refused. I was really surprised, customer service
    isn't the way it used to be, that's for sure. Sure, I was
    getting pretty angry at this point, but only because she
    wouldn't listen to me when I knew that I was right.<br>
    <br>
    It was at this point that I remembered I had ordered a second
    SIM card when I bought the $1 SIM for activating the Galaxy 2
    for my wife! I totally forgot about this - since they are only
    $1, I bought two just in case I needed another pre-pay SIM for
    some reason in the future.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Thirty minutes later, it was all done - I did the conversion
    from post-pay to a pre-pay plan that T-Mobile says there's no
    way you can get. And here's how you do it:</b><br>
    <br>

    <ol>
      <li>Wait until you contract is nearly up. Don't blame me if
      you screw this part up and have contract cancellation
      fees!</li>

      <li>Go to the T-Mobile online store and order a new pre-pay
      SIM card for your phone for $1 plus shipping.</li>

      <li>Wait a few days for the SIM card to arrive.</li>

      <li>Activate the SIM card online, and choose the $30 plan
      with <b>unlimited text, unlimited data, 100 minutes talk</b>.
      And do not, under any circumstance, call T-Mobile customer
      support as part of the activation! Don't forget to port your
      old number over at the appropriate place in the process (and
      if you can't do it at the time of activation, you can always
      do that bit later, as we did for my wife's phone).</li>

      <li>Cancel your old plan.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <b><i>That's all there is to it - that's how you do the
    impossible, to get the plan that T-Mobile says you cannot
    have.</i></b>
