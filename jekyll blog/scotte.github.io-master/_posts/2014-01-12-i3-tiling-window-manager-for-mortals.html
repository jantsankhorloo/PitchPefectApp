    After kicking around a few different desktop environments and
    window managers, I've settled in with <a href=
    "http://i3wm.org/">i3</a> as my window manager of choice - and
    no desktop environment at all. This is by far the most
    productive user interface I've used and is now in residence on
    my home laptop, work laptop, work desktop, and shiny new
    Intel-based Chromebook (as well as it's predecessor - an
    ARM-based Chromebook). I'm still using the <a href=
    "https://www.debian.org">Debian</a> distribution of Linux (mostly Wheezy, but also one Jessie/Testing), which has been
    fantastic - and I can't recommend it enough.<br>
    <br>

    You can read <a href= "http://www.sail2software.com/2013/10/my-bluetile-based-xmonad-configuration.html">my previous blog</a> for the few weeks that I used a
    BlueTile-derived <a href="http://xmonad.org/">xmonad</a>
    configuration on top of the <a href=
    "http://www.xfce.org/">xfce</a> desktop environment. While this
    worked pretty well most of the time, and was fairly productive,
    xmonad is a pain as it requires writing haskell code to change
    the configuration. A found this to be a bit burdensome over
    time - when I just want to tweak a setting I'd much rather just
    tweak the setting, and not have to debug code.<br>
    <br>
    i3 is just about as flexible as xmonad, but everything is in a
    regular configuration file, so it doesn't require users to
    write their own window manager in haskell to get the
    configuration you want.<br>
    <br>
    It's easy to plug-in different implementations in i3 for cases
    where the configuration isn't sufficient - for example I found
    the default i3 status bar to be a bit limiting for the
    configuration I wanted, so I handle that via <a href=
    "http://conky.sourceforge.net/">conky</a>, outputting in JSON
    (i.e. not using conky's X integration at all) to i3. System
    notifications come via <a href=
    "http://www.knopwob.org/dunst/index.html">dunst</a>. <a href=
    "http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a>&nbsp;is used as a
    launcher. Everything plays nicely together, and configuration
    is a snap.<br>
    <br>
    Not running a regular desktop environment has not in any way
    been an issue. I can still use any application (for example,
    see "gnome-screenshot" used in the screenshot above, although more
    recently I've switched to "scrot"). I don't
    use graphical file managers as a general rule, and while I
    could probably install nautilus or thunar, I've found rox-filer
    works just as well and doesn't require many dependencies.
    Debian already includes the necessary wiring such that
    installing i3-wm sets up a lightdm session.<br>
    <br>
    Suspend, shutdown, reboot, logout is handled via simple
    keybindings in i3 or from a terminal - I have no problem typing
    "sudo shutdown -h now", and I can type it just as fast as
    navigating to some menu.<br>
    <br>
    I found that I was comfortable and productive in i3 within just
    a few days - you definitely have to make a commitment to learn
    keybindings and modes, and understand the container model, but
    once you do it's amazing how quickly you can navigate
    applications, workspaces, and desktops without ever having to
    take your hands off the keyboard. Learning how to effectively
    use workspaces for your workflow is super important - i3 allows
    several different layouts and each workspace can have it's own.
    Switching between layouts is a snap, and I find myself
    switching, for example, from a tiling layout to a tabbed layout
    to get a larger window. i3 remembers layouts, so switching back
    to tiling puts everything back how it was before. Very
    nice.<br>
    <br>
    Anyone who's ever seen my desktop knows that I like to have a
    lot of terminal windows open, very specifically placed. In a
    traditional window manager doing this is painful - either I
    open a bunch of terminals, and manually move them around and
    resize them (I absolutely <b>hate</b> doing this), or write a
    script that starts all the terminals with the right geometry
    (also a painful operation, working out the geometry of each
    window). With i3, and a tiling layout, you never worry about
    window geometry or location - which is awesome. If I want 4
    equally sized terminals on a workspace (with a horizontal
    tiling default layout), I use the following keystrokes -
    Super-Enter, Super-Enter, Super-v, Super-Enter, Super-Left,
    Super-v, Super-Enter. Once you learn the keybindings and
    container model, this sort of sequence becomes second nature
    and takes just a few seconds.<br>
    <br>
    This configuration is really great and runs fast, with low
    resource usage - very important when running on a Chromebook
    (my install only requires around 2GB of disk) and gives more
    resources to things such as Java VMs when running on my fat
    work desktop.<br>
    <br>
    I've decided not to dump my configuration in this post - code
    in blogger doesn't work all that well (see my previous post)
    and the configuration gets stale when I don't bother to update
    it (also see my previous post, which does not reflect my final
    configuration). Although it won't help with the latter, you can
    find my configs, at least some version of it, <a href=
    "https://github.com/scotte/linux-configs">on github</a>.<br>
