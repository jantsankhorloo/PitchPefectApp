    Yes, you'll see lots of Amazon product links on this blog. Why?
    Three reasons:<br>
    <br>
    1. Amazon has the best product information available on the
    net.&nbsp;I think it's pretty hard to dispute this. Amazon has
    done a fantastic job of bring info into their site - combining
    general and detailed technical information with user reviews.
    And then of course you can buy everything directly from them.
    Which leads to:<br>
    <br>
    2. If you are going to buy it, I appreciate the referral. One
    of the points of this blog is to share various projects as well
    as products that I'm using, investigating, or complaining
    about. These links give instant gratification for you to check
    things out for yourself - or even buy directly if you are so
    inclined.<br>
    <br>
    3. This is to some degree an experiment into contextual
    monetization, but hopefully in way that is useful to readers.
    I'll write more about this, and previous experiences with site
    monetization, another time.<br>
