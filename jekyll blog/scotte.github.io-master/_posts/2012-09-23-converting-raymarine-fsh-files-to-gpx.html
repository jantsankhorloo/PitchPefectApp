  <div class='post'>
    I've always been a bit annoyed by not being able to convert
    data from my Raymarine C-Series chartplotter into an open and
    accessible format, such as GPX. Although there are some tools
    available that support the FSH files written by these
    chartplotters, they are either not-free or very limited - such
    as not supporting all data (such as tracks), or by only running
    on Windows.<br>

      I want to be able to back up the data (waypoints, routes, and
      tracks) on my chartplotter and load it into <a href=
      "http://opencpn.org/">OpenCPN</a>, so I started to write a
      python script to do so, <a href=
      "https://github.com/scotte/fsh2gpx">available on github</a>.
      In it's current form it's very rough but exports waypoints
      and routes to GPX which I can then import into OpenCPN.

      The script doesn't yet support tracks, nor is it very
      resilient or stable in decoding values, but it's a start.
      Since no other freely available, cross-platform solution
      exists for converting FSH files, this is a free, open-source
      project licensed under the GPL.

      Long term, once the FSH format is fully decoded, the plan is
      to turn this into a
      <a href="https://www.gpsbabel.org/">GPS Babel</a>
      module. Until then, give this Python script a try.
