    One of the many sacrifices made during the four year "planning
    for the big cruise" phase was to do minimal technology upgrades
    - electronics, computers, phones, etc. Aside from things needed
    for the boat (navigation, radar, etc) we tried to limit
    purchases to what we really needed bare minimum and just
    through our planned six-month trip.<br>
    <br>
    As my facebook friends already know from my making good use of
    the novelty of "checking in", I've got a new phone - an

    width="1">. This is a really incredible device... A huge step
    up from the cheapest Nokia and Samsung phones that we've been
    using for the past dozen years. The number and richness of
    available apps is just huge. The GPS navigation means I won't
    be pulling out my trusty old <a href=

    was 4 years ago when I bought it, but there's just no
    comparison with what these smartphone devices can do...<br>
    <br>
    Access to my personal email, IM, skype and corporate email,
    calendar, yammer means I can't hide anymore!&nbsp;Both WIFI and
    USB tethering work out of the box - which means a laptop can
    get internet access anywhere the phone has data service,
    instead of having to rely on WIFI hotspots.<br>
    <br>
    As everyone who hasn't been living under a rock (or perhaps
    sailing in Mexico) knows, the market is dominated by the Apple
    iPhone and Android devices. Microsoft is too late, and has
    never done well in this space despite a decade of trying. The
    Blackberry is quickly losing it's status as the darling of the
    business world - especially as more and more companies allow
    access to corporate mail from iPhones and Androids. Ultimately
    this saves companies money as well, at least in the technology
    sector, as people generally are willing to buy their own
    personal devices if such access is allowed by corporate
    policy.<br>
    <br>
    As far as the decision between choosing an Android versus an
    iPhone? Well, that's a personal choice, just like buying a
    Toyota versus a Ford, or going to Carl's Jr instead of Taco
    Bell. For me, there was no debating the decision. I think
    Apple's hardware design is incredible - they have the best
    industrial design on the planet with slick and slim devices,
    and well done user interfaces. The problem, is that when you
    buy an Apple device you are forced into drinking the cool-aid
    as you are locked into the Apple way of doing things. I'm not a
    big fan of that approach, no surprise to those that know my
    opinions on the Open Source model. With Android you have a
    choice of many different phones and carriers, plus you can
    install apps from anywhere - not just the hardware, software,
    and carrier that Apple has decided is best for me.<br>
    <br>
    Ultimately, I believe the Apple lock-in mentality will be their
    downfall, and already their market share has been eroded by
    Android devices as <a href=
    "http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2011/1/comScore_Reports_November_2010_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share">Android just surpassed Apple in market share</a>, a pretty big
    ramp up considering what a head start Apple had on everyone
    else in the market.<br>
    <br>
    Now, don't go buying an Android just because it's what I happen
    to like - make your own decision. There's actually a lot to be
    said for my old dumbphone - it was cheaper and I didn't waste
    nearly so much time playing around with it. When we'd go out to
    eat we'd just talk, and then eat. Now I seem to be checking
    into facebook, checking into foursquare, checking into yelp,
    checking into ... :-)
