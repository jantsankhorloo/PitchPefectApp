  <div class='post'>
    <span class="Apple-style-span" style=
    "font-size: large;">Welcome to my new blog project -
    <b>sail-2-software</b>!</span><br>
    <br>
    As we make the transition back to living on land after a
    six-month leave of absence to sail down to Mexico, I'm finding
    lots of things to write about. Sound and video electronics, as
    we furnish an apartment. New computer and mobile devices as
    we've lifted our three-year moratorium on upgrades. New
    software development languages, frameworks, and infrastructure
    as I start new projects at work. And of course boating and
    sailing will be represented as well, hence the theme and title
    - <i><b>everything from sail-2-software</b></i>...<br>
    <br>
    You can read our cruising blog, about the <a href=
    "http://svjaneo.com/">voyage of our catamaran S/V Jane'O</a>.
    At times I'm sure these blogs will intersect as technology
    clearly crosses over to my love of sailing and
    cruising.&nbsp;<a href=
    "http://svjaneo.com/">http://svjaneo.com</a> will continue to
    focus on travels and stories interest directly related to our
    cruising life, where this blog has a much more general
    focus.<br>
    <br>
    Enjoy, check back ofter, and please stay with me as this thing
    comes together!
