    This is very interesting - the company <a href=
    "http://lightsquared.com/">LightSquared</a> was recently
    granted a waiver by the FCC to install 40,000 terrestrial
    broadcasting stations in the US that will likely interfere with
    GPS. These stations will be allowed to broadcast on the radio
    spectrum adjacent to the GPS spectrum.<br>
    <br>
    In testing so far, GPS signals have been found to be completely
    jammed at up to around 6 miles from the LightSquared sites.<br>
    <br>
    As much as I understand the issues with wireless data broadband
    capacity, allowing a waiver which will result in jamming of GPS
    signals is not the way to go.<br>

    wrong with the FCC...
