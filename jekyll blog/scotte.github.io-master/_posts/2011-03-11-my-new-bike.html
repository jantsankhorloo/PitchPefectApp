  <div class='post'>
    Now that I'm within walking/biking distance from work, I asked
    around at work if anyone had a used bike they would be
    interested in selling. Got a fantastic deal from a coworker on
    this bike, which is in great shape and rides well:<br>
    <br>

    <div class="separator" style=
    "clear: both; text-align: center;">
      <a href=
      "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WsmPR2Y-FV0/TXpV6pE1hqI/AAAAAAAAE7A/LCEcV6_HbSQ/s1600/2011-03-11+09.01.15.jpg"
      imageanchor="1" style=
      "margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0"
      height="300" src=
      "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WsmPR2Y-FV0/TXpV6pE1hqI/AAAAAAAAE7A/LCEcV6_HbSQ/s400/2011-03-11+09.01.15.jpg"
      width="400"></a>
    </div><br>
    I'll probably swap out the knobby tires for some semi-slicks
    like I put on my last mountain bike, which I mainly road on the
    streets and paved trails.
