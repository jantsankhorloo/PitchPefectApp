Yesterday I cooked this [Cornell Chicken recipe](http://virtualweberbullet.com/chicken3.html)
in my Weber Smokey Mountain (WSM) and it turned out great!

The Cornell Chicken recipe comes from Robert Baker who was a professor at
Cornell University and founded the Food Science Institute at that college.

There are variations on the original Cornell recipe, and the baste I used
(recipe link above, from [virtualweberbullet.com](http://virtualweberbullet.com))
uses a base of dijon, cider vinegar, and rosemary and it came out splendidly! I
used a blend of cherry and apple woods.

I butterflied the chicken and brined it first, but this is a very versatile recipe
that could be cooked with any chicken parts or preparation and in any grill or
BBQ - gas, charcoal, a Traeger, etc.
