    Recently I stumbled across <a href="http://mxmariner.com/">MX Mariner</a>, a nifty chart plotter app for Android phones and
    tablets. This is well worth checking out, and it's only $7 in
    the Android app store.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="separator" style=
    "clear: both; text-align: center;">
      <a href=

      "margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://mxmariner.org/img/rte_active.png"></a>

    While pretty new and still under active development, MX Mariner
    is better than nearly every other marine charting app in the
    Android store - and certainly nothing can beat it at this
    price. Many charting apps are impractical for real use as they
    require a live and fast data connection, they require saving
    charts one-by-one in advance, or they don't support chart
    quilting at all. With MX Mariner, you download a region when
    you have a good wifi connection - these are big files,
    150-250MB, but once you have the file for a region, MX Mariner
    will automatically quilt charts for that reason as you navigate
    - and no data connection is required! Note that switching to
    Google Earth view does require an active data connection, but
    since the primary point of this is for marine charts, that's
    reasonable.<br>
    <br>
    Some features, like GPX import/export are still under
    development, expect to see new features soon! Like <a href=
    "http://opencpn.org/">OpenCPN</a>, MX Mariner embraces
    iterative development, and you can even <a href=
    "http://github.com/manimaul/MX-Mariner">contribute</a> if you
    so desire. If you notice some similarities between OpenCPN and
    MX Mariner, that's no accident - as the primary developer of MX
    Mariner is also a contributor of OpenCPN.<br>
    <br>
    Currently, MX Mariner has somewhat limited world coverage, take
    a look at the <a href="http://mxmariner.com/">website</a> for
    more details.<br>
    <br>
    So, if you are looking for an Android based chart plotter app,
    give this one a try! It works great on our Samsung Galaxy-S
    phone, and HTC Flyer 7" tablet. Looking forward to see what
    features come next!
