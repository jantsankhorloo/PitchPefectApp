    There's a battle brewing between Amazon and the record labels
    over amazon's new cloud player, which lets you upload your MP3s
    to the cloud, and play them anywhere you have internet access
    over a computer or Android phone.<br>
    <br>
    You can upload 5GB of MP3s for free. Higher storage capacities
    cost 20GB for $20/year, and so on.<br>
    <br>
    Apparently the record labels are having quite a fit over this
    service, even though it only lets you play music that's you've
    uploaded yourself. It shows that the record companies have
    absolutely no clue at all, actually. If it's legal to play from
    my portable player, and it's legal to play from my computer,
    then it sure seems to me it's legal to play from my Amazon
    Cloud Drive, or whatever/wherever.<br>
    <br>
    The fact that the record companies have not figured out how to
    do business in the digital world is the primary reason that I
    stopped buying any music, other than what I can legally get DRM
    free.<br>
    <br>
    On a related note, I just finished converting (again, perfectly
    legally) Chris' entire music collection over from iTunes format
    to MP3. Now she can listen to her music anywhere on any device.
    She's happy to be free of iTunes horrible interface and
    software, using winamp currently to manage her collection and
    device (it works nicely, I have to say). Freedom to do what we
    want with our own, legally acquired content, is a good
    thing!<br>
