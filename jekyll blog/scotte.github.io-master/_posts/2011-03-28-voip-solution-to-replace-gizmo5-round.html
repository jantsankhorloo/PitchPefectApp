    <b><i>NOTE: If you are serious about undertaking this solution,
    you probably want to read the updates at the bottom of this
    entry, as we have now switched over to Flowroute.</i></b><br>
    <b><i><br></i></b>My <a href=
    "http://www.sail2software.com/2011/03/voip-solution-to-replace-gizmo5.html">super cheap VOIP solution</a>
    was a great idea, but it had some
    issues with inbound calls.<br>
    <br>
    So now, I'm giving <a href=
    "http://www.callcentric.com/">CallCentric</a> a try instead -
    even though it will cost more - around $2/month for the inbound
    number, and outbound rate of $0.02/minute. Inbound calls also
    are billed at a rate of $0.015/minute, so they aren't free
    either.<br>
    <br>
    What we have found with my super cheap solution is that Caller
    ID is flaky at best (if it works at all, it's usually some
    number in Tacoma WA - probably belonging to either Google Voice
    or ipkall), and even worse - by the time inbound calls are
    forwarded through all the services and our phone rings, Google
    Voice gives up and forwards the call to voice mail. So our
    phone rings, and we pick it up, but there's nobody there -
    because the caller is already leaving a message on GV.<br>
    <br>
    Here's what the new configuration looks like:<br>
    <br>

    <div class="separator" style=
    "clear: both; text-align: center;">
      <a href=
      "/images/newVOIPredux.png"
      imageanchor="1" style=
      "margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src=
      "/images/newVOIPredux.png"></a>
    </div><br>
    This is a very simple configuration, consisting of our ATA and
    CallCentric, plus Google Voice. Our GV number will be forwarded
    to the CallCentric DID (in fact, both numbers are in the same
    Central Office), and CallCentric will send the GV CallerID on
    outbound calls - they just needed to verify that the number,
    indeed, belonged to me.<br>
    <br>
    As far as ATA configuration goes, it was easy and simple, and
    well documented at CallCentric's site for those who need a bit
    more guidance at all the required SIP configuration values.<br>
    <br>
    Some additional pluses:<br>
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li>I get the G729a codec back, as CallCentric supports
      it.</li>

      <li>CallCentric supports 911 service. There's a small
      surcharge associated with it, $3 at sign-up. I don't know if
      there is a monthly fee or tax as well.</li>

      <li>Some other nifty features you can <a href=
      "https://www.callcentric.com/new/">read about here</a>.</li>
    </ul><span style=
    "font-size: large;">UPDATE&nbsp;2012-11-08:</span><br>
    <br>
    After about 20 months with Callcentric I've switched to
    Flowroute as a result of about 4 weeks of flaky or down service
    due to DDOS and then superstorm Sandy.<br>
