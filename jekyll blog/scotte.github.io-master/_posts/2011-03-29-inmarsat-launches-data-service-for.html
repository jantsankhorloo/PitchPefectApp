    During our sailing adventure we took along a satellite phone -
    an <a href=

    style=

    width="1"> from Inmarsat. While we only used it a few times for
    voice calls, it has the ability to send and receive short (160
    character) emails. We used this email capability often for our
    daily position reports and to keep in touch with family as well. Now,
    <a href="http://www.inmarsat.com/About/Newsroom/Press/00037329.aspx?language=EN&amp;textonly=False">Inmarsat is finally launching data service for the phone</a>.

    For our trip, Inmarsat had yet to launch full data service -
    where you plug in a computer and the phone acts like a dial-up
    modem. The latency and <i>slow</i> data rate does not make it
    anything close to a regular Internet connection - for example,
    web browsing would be not only painfully slow, but really
    expensive for the per-minute call charges. However for email,
    it's absolutely perfect, and a nice alternative to
    SSB/Pactor.<br>
    <br>
    Having this data service, and regular email access, really
    opens up what we'll be able to do with this device for the next
    trip. Not only for position reports and having access to email
    out on the high-seas to email friends+family, but the ability
    to receive weather information - for example forecasts and GRIB
    files from <a href="http://saildocs.com/">saildocs</a>.<br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.globalmarinenet.com/isatphone.php">GMN XGate</a>, which offers a compression and duplexing product
    that greatly reduces airtime charges has also already announced
    support for the phone. While XGate is moderately expensive, it
    reduces airtime charges significantly for people with lots of
    email to send.<br>
    <br>
    A full long-term review of the phone will be coming some time
    this summer, once we've had a chance to test out the data
    service.
