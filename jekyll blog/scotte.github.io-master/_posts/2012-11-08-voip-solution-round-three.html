    For 19 months I'd been pretty happy with <a href=
    "https://www.callcentric.com/">Callcentric</a> for our home
    VOIP, but that all changed last month. For two weeks,
    Callcentric was under a DDOS attack resulting in flaky service.
    Then superstorm Sandy hit the East coast. Amazingly,
    Callcentric has no redundancy or
    disaster&nbsp;preparedness&nbsp;in their system - everything is
    served out of a single datacenter in NYC with no backup in VOIP
    infrastructure. During Sandy, they didn't even bother to point
    their DNS to a temporary location so people could at least get
    a webpage with status. They just went off the wire -
    completely.<br>
    <br>
    To add insult to that injury, Callcentric made no attempt to
    proactively notify customers about the DDOS events - they only
    way I found out about it was because I found our phone wasn't
    working, so logged into my dashboard to see what was up, and
    only then got presented with a message. Not an acceptable
    amount of communication.<br>
    <br>
    I can accept one of these failures, but all these together is a
    show-stopper for me. Not having reliable (or any) phone service
    for 3-4 weeks is just not a workable solution, nor is lack of
    notifying customers. I&nbsp;say this not only as a customer,
    but as a developer of SAAS apps - I know that building a system
    capable of absorbing these types of failures is possible, if
    not simple, and really a requirement in today's wired
    world.<br>

      <br>
    </div>So a couple of weeks ago I signed up with <a href=
    "https://www.flowroute.com/">Flowroute</a> and switched the ATA
    over. So far, so good! Flowroute is not only cheaper than
    Callcentric, but DIDs (inbound phone numbers) are allocated
    instantly on demand, rather than having to wait a couple of
    days for an assignment. As an added bonus, Flowroute supports
    CNAM - which means you can add your name in outbound ANI
    (CallerID).<br>
    <br>
    So far, the Flowroute experience has been excellent. I actually
    looked at them early last year before choosing Callcentric, but
    was put off by the $35 minimum payment. I was afraid that if I
    didn't like it, or wasn't happy, that it would be a hassle to
    get a refund. So far, I don't anticipate getting a refund, as
    the service has been great. $35 goes a long way for BYOD VOIP.
    Our DID is $1.39, as is E911 service. And per-minute rates are
    about a penny (half of Callcentric).<br>
    <br>
    All the features I need are there - so feature parity, lower
    prices, and <i>hopefully</i> better service makes this a
    win.<br>
    <br>
    Configuring the Linksys PAP2TNA ATA was no problem even though
    Flowroute doesn't document a specific configuration for this
    device. They support the G729a codec. Call forwarding from
    Google Voice seems slightly faster than with Callcentric.<br>
    <br>
    Having a dual port ATA is handy when switching service, as the
    new service can be configured with no disruption to the
    old.<br>
    <br>
    We'll see if in a few months, or a year, there's a round FOUR
    to this post. I don't really know if Flowroute can provide an
    effective level of redundancy - only time will tell, as anyone
    who's been through a disaster can tell you,
    disaster&nbsp;preparedness&nbsp;drills never cover
    everything.<br>
