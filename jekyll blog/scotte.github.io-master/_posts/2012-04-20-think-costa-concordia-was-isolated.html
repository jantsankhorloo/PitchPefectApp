    Mad about Costa Concordia? You should be! But read this if you
    think it's an isolated incident that these cruise ships care
    one bit about people's lives:

    I think the answer is pretty clear: everyone should boycott the
    entire cruise ship industry. This is really sad, but it's been
    proven recently that these cruise ship companies are not
    honorable and do not deserve to be in business as they are not
    honoring international law.<br>
