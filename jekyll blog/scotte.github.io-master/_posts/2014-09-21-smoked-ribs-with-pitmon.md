While still under active development, I've been using my [pitmon](https://github.com/scotte/pitmon)
BBQ pit monitoring software along with my CyberQ WiFi for a few cooks already. Today, I
smoked 2 racks of pork ribs which turned out great.

I used the [3-2-1 Method](http://virtualweberbullet.com/rib5.html) of cooking ribs, using
a base of yellow mustard (the secret to great smoking) and a mix of commercial, off-the-shelf
pork rubs. I cooked over a mix of apple and cherry wood in my WSM (Weber Smokey Mountain)
smoker. For phase 2, where the ribs are foiled, I added some apple juice and honey.

While the ribs didn't have a particularly prominent smoke ring, they had great flavor.
The small ribs were a bit overdone (falling off the bone - you can see a lonely bone above)
where the larger ribs required just a bit of work to get the meat off the bone. Overall,
some of the best ribs I've ever made.

Here's the whole cook graph from pitmon. You can see each stage pretty readily, including
where some chunks of wood caught fire at the start of stage two when I had the smoker open
for 5 minutes or so while I wrapped each 1/2 rack in foil, driving smoker temps up for
a bit. For the final stage, where I was checking the ribs frequently, you can see how this
affects stability of temperature - compare to the first 3 hours where the smoker was never
opened.

Ribs going on the WSM - two full racks cut in half to make them a bit more manageable:

After smoking, just about to be wrapped in foil for stage 2:

I was telling the family how disappointing it is ordering ribs from some place like
Black Angus when you can make ribs in the backyard that are so much better.
