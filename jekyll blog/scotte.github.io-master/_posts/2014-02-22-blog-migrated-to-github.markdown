This blog is now being hosted on [github pages](http://pages.github.com) using
[octopress](http://octopress.org).

A large part of the reason for this is diversification away from Google. As
much as I love Google for many reasons (and will continue to be a faithful
Android user for the near future), I am moving most of my stuff off Google
infrastructure.

I'll write more about the reasons for this later, as well as mention which
services I've migrated to (email, search, browser, etc).

Please bear with me as I finish migrating all the content and fix up some formatting, images, and such here and there...

**Update**: Please see newer posts as I have abandoned Octopress for straight
Jekyll. Octopress, as it turns out, makes things harder, not simpler.
