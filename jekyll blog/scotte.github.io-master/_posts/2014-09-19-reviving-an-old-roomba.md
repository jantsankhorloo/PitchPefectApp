In 2005 we bought a Roomba red and used it for a couple of years before moving
onto our sailboat where we didn't need it anymore. I passed it on to my sister, who
used it for a couple more years before she also didn't need it anymore and put it
into storage until now.

I wasn't surprised that the original NiMh battery would no longer take a charge,
but $26 on Amazon was all it took to fix that - and the Roomba is once again alive,
much to the annoyance of our dog.

This Roomba only cost $150, and works great - especially at picking up dog hair. I
think iRobot has really lost it's way, and as a result a huge portion of the market.
The cheapest current Roomba is about $350, but most models are in the $450-$600 range.
While our Red was near the bottom of the line when we bought it 9 years ago, I can't
see any reason why they would be so much more expensive today - even accounting for
inflation, with reduction in manufacturing costs and technology getting cheaper,
these should be less expensive today than they were 9 years ago.

As a result, iRobot now has much more competition from companies like Neato. Today,
I'd never buy an overpriced Roomba, but at least our 9 year old model is still
working great!
