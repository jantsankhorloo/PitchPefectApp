    <b><i>NOTE: If you are serious about undertaking this solution,

    <br>
    From November 2009 until last week we were using <a href=
    "http://www.gizmo5.com/">Gizmo5</a> plus <a href=
    "http://voice.google.com/">Google Voice</a> for our home phone
    service, via a&nbsp;<a href=

    piece of hardware that bridges a regular old (POTS) telephone
    to IP/ethernet.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <div style=
    "margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
    The Gizmo5 solution worked pretty well, a few technical issues
    here and there, but it was fairly stable. Inbound calls were
    free, as they were routed through Google Voice. Outbound calls
    were $0.01 per minute. Our total phone bill during that 16
    months was $8.

    "margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
    Google acquired Gizmo5 about a year ago, and have now decided
    to kill the service. I was really disappointed to hear this
    decision, as I expected to see more SIP integration in Google
    Voice, not less. It seems clear that Google is not interested
    in SIP, though they are supporting XMPP - as used in Google
    Talk. And just to close up the history on this, Grand Central
    was the original company that Google bought and became Google
    Voice (GV).

    </div>

    <div style=
    "margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">
    The old solution was pretty simple to setup, as Google provided
    the integration between Gizmo5 and Google Voice via GV
    settings. Basically, you just added your Gizmo5 number to GV,
    then configured the ATA to talk to Gizmo5's SIP servers. Then
    plug in a phone and make some calls. Super easy.

    The new solution? Well it's quite a bit more complex.

    First, a few telephony acronyms for the uninitiated.<br>

    <ul>
      <li>VOIP -&nbsp;<b>Voice Over Internet Protocol</b>. Sort of
      a misnomer, as it's not really a protocol, just a
      classification.</li>

      <li>SIP -&nbsp;<b>Session Initiation Protocol</b>. This is
      the standard VOIP protocol that devices use to establish
      phone calls over the internet.</li>

      <li>ATA -&nbsp;<b>Analog Terminal Adapter</b>. The device
      that an old analog phone plugs into to bridge to a VOIP
      protocol. An alternative would be using an IP phone.</li>

      <li>POTS -&nbsp;<b>Plain Old Telephone Service</b>. The
      analog phone system, in use well over 100 years,
      amazing!</li>

      <li>DID - <b>Direct Inward Dial</b>. The ability for someone
      to call your VOIP phone from a regular phone.</li>

      <li>CID - <b>CallerID</b>. You know what this is.</li>

      <li>PBX - <b>Private Branch eXchange</b>. Essentially a
      small, private phone company. All the phones plug into this
      (either directly or virtually via a network), and it handles
      all the routing between calls or trunking to an external
      phone service (for example, calling a regular phone). PBXs
      provide other features, such as voice mail, caller ID, and
      management of IP phones - to provide a few examples.</li>

      <li>PSTN - <b>Public Switched Telephone Network</b>. This is
      the huge network of wires, switches, central offices, and so
      forth that give us POTS.</li>
    </ul>The new solution consists of the following bits and
    pieces:<br>

    <ul>
      <li><a href=

      target="_blank">Linksys ATA</a><img alt="" border="0" height=

      style=
      "border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;"
      width="1"> - The same device used for Gizmo5.</li>

      <li><a href="http://www.pbxes.com/">PBXes</a>&nbsp;- An
      internet based virtual PBX. The ATA talks to this
      service.</li>

      <li><a href="http://www.ipkall.com/">ipkall</a> - Provides
      free DID. This gives me a phone number regular phones can
      dial.</li>

      <li><a href="http://www.callwithus.com/">CallWithUs</a> -
      Outbound phone trunk. This is used for outbound calls to the
      PSTN.</li>

      <li><a href="http://voice.google.com/">Google Voice</a> -
      Yep, that</li>
    </ul>It could be simpler, but not with the breadth of features
    we get and also making it as cheap as possible - in this case
    it means nearly free! Inbound calls cost nothing. Outbound
    calls are as low as $0.01 with CallWithUs. I can swap in
    different outbound trunks trivially via PBXes - I can even have
    multiple services with complex routing rules. Very cool hackish
    stuff.<br>
    <br>
    Here's an overview of how it all fits together (the arrows show
    direction of call initiation):<br>
    <br>

    <div class="separator" style=
    "clear: both; text-align: center;">
      <a href=
      "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9qrX8vTK_wo/TXwaYJmmJnI/AAAAAAAAE7Y/mcIDoGat2Lk/s1600/newVOIP.png"
      imageanchor="1" style=
      "margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src=
      "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9qrX8vTK_wo/TXwaYJmmJnI/AAAAAAAAE7Y/mcIDoGat2Lk/s1600/newVOIP.png"></a>
    </div><br>
    The only number people need to know is our Google Voice number.
    Dialing it rings our home phone. Likewise, outbound calls work
    just as you would expect from a regular phone. Outbound
    CallerID is "spoofed" with our Google Voice number. This
    spoofing of the number makes sense, since it <b>is</b> our
    valid phone number - we aren't sending some fake number or
    anything dumb like that.<br>
    <br>
    When the ATA boots up, it establishes a connection to the PBXes
    SIP switch. They use an Asterisk based system, and for a basic
    system (like this) it's a free service. Once the ATA is
    registered with the switch, the phone line is provisioned and
    that connection stays nailed up. The ATA has some options to
    help with NAT traversal and keeping the IP sockets
    connected.<br>
    <br>
    Inbound calls to our Google Voice number get forwarded to our
    ipkall DID number. This is some random phone number in
    Washington state. ipkall bridges that via SIP to PBXes, which
    then forwards that to our ATA. PBXes has all sorts of various
    options in terms of call display, hunt groups, forwarding, and
    all that other nifty PBX stuff - but in our case it's really
    simple, as we have just one registered extension and all calls
    go directly to it.<br>
    <br>
    Outbound calls go to PBXes where an outbound trunk is selected.
    Again, it's possible to have all sorts of routing rules with
    multiple providers, but we are using just one - which is
    CallWithUs. PBXes sends the call via SIP to CallWithUs, which
    bridges the call out to the PSTN. This is the only leg that
    costs anything, with calls to the USA at $0.01 per minute. And
    we can always use Google Voice to initiate the call with their
    callback service, making calls free. One thing I like about
    CallWithUs is that you can purchase time in $5 increments.<br>
    <br>
    There's quite a bit of configuration required to the various
    services to make sure they all talk to each other.<br>
    <br>
    Out of the box, CallWithUs, like most SIP to PSTN services,
    requires a full dialing string that includes country code. The
    solution to this is to setup a dialplan on the ATA allowing
    standard 7 and 10 digit dialing:<br>

    <blockquote>
      <span class="Apple-style-span" style=
      "font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">(&lt;:1&gt;xxxxxxxxxx|&lt;:1530&gt;xxxxxxx|&lt;411:18004664411&gt;|*xx|[3469]11|0|00|[2-9]xxxxxx|1xxx[2-9]xxxxxxS0|xxxxxxxxxxxx.)</span>
    </blockquote>I won't go into all the entries but basically this
    tells the ATA &nbsp;what to do with various dialed numbers,
    inserting missing digits or replacing numbers entirely. For
    example, the first entry automatically prefixes a 10-digit
    number with the "1" country code for the USA. The second, uses
    area code "530" for 7-digit dialing. The third entry forwards
    calls to "411" to the Google directly service. An option to do
    here is cause a call to be initiated immediately once the
    dialplan has been fulfilled - which is what the <b>S0</b>
    suffix does, but it can be tricky. Without it, the ATA would
    wait for awhile to see if you have more digits to dial. A good
    full tutorial on this is <a href=
    "http://www.netphonedirectory.com/pap2_dialplan.htm">here</a>.<br>
    <br>
    The dial string rules could also be done in PBXes, though there
    would still be a delay for the ATA to wait for all dialing
    digits. A hybrid approach would be worthwhile - use the ATA
    configuration for 10 and 7 digit, and the various other, basic
    dial rules - as well as dial immediately when it can. Use the
    PBXes configuration for forwarding services.<br>
    <br>
    This would also be the appropriate place for routing 911 calls
    to some local emergency number - <b>and that brings up one
    very, very important issue: This solution does not provide
    traditional 911 service</b>. We have enough cell phones that
    I'm not worried about it, but it's worth thinking about how you
    would handle it for your case.<br>
    <br>
    The only existing issue is that some incoming calls do not have
    the original caller's Caller ID showing up on the phone when
    people call us, instead showing some Washington number. Not
    entirely sure why this is occurring. Outbound Caller ID works
    flawlessly.<br>
    <br>
    Also, I had to use the G711u codec. It works fine, but G729a
    uses less bandwidth and the voice quality is still
    excellent.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Here's
    screenshots and details for configuration:</span><br>
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://callwithus.com/">CallWithUs</a> - No
      configuration needed for the service, just an active account
      and call credit balance. PBXes is a client to this service.
      You do need connection and account information to provide
      PBXes, and CallWithUs has decent documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://pbxes.com/">PBXes</a> - Lots of
        configuration required here. You need to define an
        extension (with a username and password for the ATA to
        authenticate as). You need an outbound trunk configured
        (CallWithUs in my case). You need a default route that
        sends all inbound calls to the extension. You need a
        default route that send all outbound calls to the
        trunk.</li>
      </ul>

      <div>
        <span class="Apple-style-span" style=
        "font-size: large;">Extension configuration:</span>
      </div>

      <div>
        <i>Username</i> will look something like "<b>foo-100</b>",
        where "<b>foo</b>" is your PBXes account, and <b>100</b> is
        the extension number. The <i>Password</i> you pick, and
        will be configured into the ATA and ipkall. The <i>Dial</i>
        field would look like "<b>SIP/foo-100</b>" for this
        example. Note <i>dtmfmode</i> of "<b>info</b>" - this
        setting here, and in the ATA, was required for Google Voice
        to accept DTMF tones to validate my ipkall DID number for
        GV to forward calls to it. <i>Outbound CID</i> is our GV
        number.

    <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">UPDATE
    03/14:</span><br>
    <br>
    An&nbsp;acquaintance&nbsp;mentioned the use of CallCentric for
    a VOIP provider. There are a number of one-stop VOIP providers
    that don't involve or require this complex of a setup. The
    advantage of a one-stop solution is simplicity - only one thing
    to configure, although you can still use a GV number for
    incoming calls. I looked into CallCentric, but their rate was
    higher at $0.02/minute. I scouted out a few other ones as well
    - one wanted $35 in initial calling credits, which was more
    than I was willing to spend up front (and I was still only
    going to use them as an outbound trunk, not for a DID
    number).<br>
    <br>
    For anyone seriously considering a VOIP solution, I would also
    say that you don't have to do anything complex like the above.
    There are lots of one-stop VOIP providers that will allow a
    simple setup - and it's still going to be <b>significantly</b>
    cheaper and better than, say, Vonage or or Comcast VOIP.<br>

    Well, it was a great idea, but due to some issues with inbound
    calls, I'm giving CallCentric a try instead - even though it
    will cost more - around $2/month for the inbound number, and
    outbound rate of $0.02/minute. Inbound calls also are billed at
    a rate of $0.02, so they aren't free either.

    What we have found is that Caller ID is flaky at best (if it
    works at all, it's usually some number in Tacoma WA - probably
    belonging to either Google Voice or ipkall), and even worse -
    by the time inbound calls are forwarded through all the
    services and our phone rings, Google Voice gives up and
    forwards the call to voice mail. So our phone rings, and we
    pick it up, but there's nobody there - because the caller is
    already leaving a message on GV.

    This is a very simple configuration, consisting of our ATA and
    CallCentric, plus Google Voice.&nbsp;Our GV number will be
    forwarded to the CallCentric DID (in fact, both numbers are in
    the same Central Office), and CallCentric will send the GV
    CallerID on outbound calls - they just needed to verify that
    the number, indeed, belonged to me.

    Now we shall see if CallWithUs gives me back my $4 calling
    credit... Otherwise there are some LONG outbound phone calls in
    our future! :-)

    After about 20 months with Callcentric I've switched to
    Flowroute as a result of about 4 weeks of flaky or down service
    due to DDOS and then superstorm Sandy.<br>
