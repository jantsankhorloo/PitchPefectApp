    Yep, I originally posted this on our <a href=
    "http://svjaneo.com/">cruising blog</a>&nbsp;last year - so I
    apologize for everyone who's already seen it, but for everyone
    else, this is a great money-saving tip!<br>
    <br>
    <b>Did you know that the popcorn kernel doesn't care how it
    gets hot?</b>&nbsp;Yep, that's right. This is the big secret
    that the companies making microwave popcorn don't want you to
    know. You can make microwave popcorn for about 1/10th the cost
    - and it's healthier because <i>you</i> control what
    ingredients go into it.&nbsp;This comes via our good friends
    the Knutson's.<br>

    It's really simple, but it'll take a few batches to get things
    dialed in.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Here's all you need</b>:<br>

    <ul>
      <li>Popcorn. Just your regular bag or container of raw
      popcorn kernels.</li>

      <li>Small paper lunch bags. Cheap, and you can use them more
      than once. <b>WARNING:<span class="Apple-style-span" style=
      "font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;</span></b><span class=
      "Apple-style-span" style=
      "font-family: inherit;"><b>&nbsp;Many black inks have metal
      in them and MAY start a fire in the microwave - OK, they WILL
      start a fire. Please don't reuse bags with printing on
      them!</b></span></li>

      <li>Cooking spray. We just use a generic supermarket brand
      which is very low fat and low calorie. You can even skip
      this, if just making plain popcorn.</li>

      <li>Topping. Whatever you want to sprinkle on top. Salt,
      Garlic salt, Pepper, Cajun seasoning,&nbsp;<span class=
      "Apple-style-span" style=
      "font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">&agrave;&curren;&reg;&agrave;&curren;&cedil;&agrave;&curren;&frac34;&agrave;&curren;&sup2;&agrave;&curren;&frac34;,&nbsp;</span>Plain.
      It's up to you.</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
      <b>The basic cooking procedure is really simple</b>:
    </div>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>Spoon popcorn into paper bag. (Exact amount will come
        from the dial-in procedure).</li>

        <li>Fold over the top of the bag and stick it into the
        microwave.</li>

        <li>Start the microwave.</li>

        <li>Stop the microwave once popping is complete.</li>

        <li>Pour it into a large bowl.</li>

        <li>Spray on some cooking spray, and shake. Repeat.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle&nbsp;on some topping, and shake. Repeat.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      Seriously, it's <i>that easy</i>. And don't throw the bag
      away, you can use it for 2 or 3 batches most of the time -
      use it until the bag splits!
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      <b>Now comes the dial-in procedure</b>.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      This will take a few batches, but it's no big deal, and once
      you find out exactly the right amount of popcorn and time for
      your microwave, it'll work perfectly every time.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      We start with 3 tablespoons of popcorn per bag, and use the
      microwave's built-in "popcorn" program to start with,
      otherwise start with 2:30 or so and adjust upwards or
      downwards as needed. Pay attention to the sound of popping in
      the last minute or so of the cycle. If it's still popping
      when the microwave is done, then you need less popcorn, or
      increase time. If popping stops, then stop the microwave
      before it burns, and you'll need to reduce time, or use more
      popcorn.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      The dial-in procedure is that simple - <b>either add more
      popcorn, increase time, or reduce the time - and after a few
      batches you'll find the perfect setting for your
      microwave.</b>
    </div>

    <div>
      <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style=
      "font-weight: normal;"><br></span></b>
    </div>

    <div>
      <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style=
      "font-weight: normal;">M</span></b>aybe you'll find a second
      batch is needed (wanted?), but that's no problem either -
      since this is so cheap you'll just make 2 or 3 bags without
      thinking about it. Put any un-popped kernels back in the bag,
      along with your regular dial-in amount and cook another
      batch.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      That's it! That's all there is to cheap microwave popcorn, at
      about 1/10th the cost of "microwave popcorn" sold in the
      stores. And you choose exactly what you want to put on it -
      not only is it healthier, but you will come up with awesome
      things to sprinkle on top that the popcorn companies would
      never think to sell!
