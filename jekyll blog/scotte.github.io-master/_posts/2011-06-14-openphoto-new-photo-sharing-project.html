    A friend of mine recently quit his job at Yahoo to start a neat
    new project, OpenPhoto - and it's a really cool concept. Unlike
    the existing photo sharing sites, OpenPhoto gives you full and
    absolute control of your pictures, as your photos are stored in
    your own storage bucket, rather than theirs.<br>
    <br>
    Interested in helping Jaisen get this project off the ground
    and free your photos? Head over to the
    <a href=
    "http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jmathai/openphoto-a-photo-service-for-your-s3-or-dropbox-a">kickstart project page</a>.
    Pledge a few bucks to help Jaisen
    meet his funding goals - just don't mention the sideburns!
    :-)<br>
