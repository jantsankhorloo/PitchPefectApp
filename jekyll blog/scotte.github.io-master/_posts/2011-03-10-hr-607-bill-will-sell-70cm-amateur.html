    While I'm not a current ham radio licensee, I came across the
    following, which is of interest to anyone who is. The
    Department of Homeland Security is considering a swap which
    result in the loss of most of the 70cm amateur radio band.<br>
    <br>
    From&nbsp;<a href=
    "https://www.arrl.org/hr-607">https://www.arrl.org/hr-607</a>:<br>
    <br>

    <blockquote>
      On February 10, 2011, Rep. Peter King (R-NY), Chairman of the
      House Homeland Security Committee, introduced H.R. 607, the
      &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Broadband for First Responders Act of
      2011,&acirc;&euro; which has been referred to the House
      Energy and Commerce Committee (which handles
      telecommunications legislation). &nbsp;The bill addresses
      certain spectrum management issues including the creation and
      maintenance of a nationwide Public Safety broadband
      network.&nbsp;
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      As part of that network, the Bill provides for the allocation
      of the so-called &acirc;&euro;&oelig;D-Block&acirc;&euro; of
      spectrum in the 700 MHz range for Public Safety use. HR 607
      uniquely, provides for the reallocation of other spectrum for
      auction to commercial users, in order to offset the loss of
      revenue that would occur as the result of the allocation of
      the D-Block to Public Safety instead of commercial auction.
      H.R. 607 lists, among the bands to be reallocated for
      commercial auction within ten years of the passage of the
      Bill, the paired bands 420-440 MHz and 450-470
      MHz.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      The inclusion of most of the Amateur 70-cm spectrum as one of
      the replacement bands is a major problem. The 420-440 MHz
      band is not Public Safety spectrum and should not be included
      in any spectrum swap of Public Safety allocations.&nbsp;
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      While the ARRL and all Amateurs support the work of Public
      Safety and recognize their need for dedicated spectrum which
      would promote interoperability, the ARRL vigorously opposes
      HR 607 in its present form. HR 607 is a direct threat to our
      limited spectrum and the ARRL encourages all amateurs to
      appropriately voice their opposition to this bill.
