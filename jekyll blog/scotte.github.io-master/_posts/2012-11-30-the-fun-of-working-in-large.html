    The following is a real email from a decade ago, with only the
    names removed, from a mid-sized software development company
    that was very&nbsp;bureaucratic. As you can probably imagine
    after reading this, the company had a very old-school, throw it
    over the wall, development lifecycle - long release cycles,
    little interaction between developers and QA, and no coding
    until the design is "perfect". They even had a "no prototyping"
    policy - one of the engineering upper-ups said that a
    professional engineer should be experienced enough to know what
    they need to build the first time and it's not OK to throw away
    code. I'm not kidding! You can imagine how productive this
    environment was, and the resulting quality of the code.<br>
    <br>
    If there's one reason to move to an agile lifecycle with a
    flexible work environment, just avoiding condescending, morale
    destroying emails like this is enough!<br>
    <br>
    Enjoy.<br>

    <span style=
    "font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">There
    is standards that we need to follow for safety, cost and
    equity&nbsp;purposes. Unfortunately, I'm finding that I need to
    step in here and&nbsp;remind everyone of these standards and
    policys. These are not new&nbsp;standards. They have been in
    place for quite some time. So let me be&nbsp;the&nbsp;one to
    remind you of the following:</span><br>
    <span style=
    "font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">1)
    Chairs - Each associate is issued one task chair. These are
    the&nbsp;ones&nbsp;you are sitting in. A manager is issued one
    task chair and one side&nbsp;chair.&nbsp;A Director is issued
    one task chair and two side chairs.
    The&nbsp;conference&nbsp;rooms have been furnished with the
    appropriate amount of chairs&nbsp;depending&nbsp;on the size of
    the room. Teams areas have been issued
    appropriate&nbsp;chairs.&nbsp;That's it.&nbsp;Therefore, there
    will be no side chairs issued to an 8X8 cubicle.
    I&nbsp;know&nbsp;some of you have modified cubicles that would
    accommodate&nbsp;an&nbsp;additional&nbsp;chair, but this is not
    going to happen. Those that currently have an&nbsp;additional
    chair, will return them to me. Those that are requesting
    an&nbsp;additional chair can stop asking.&nbsp;Now then, if
    someone wants to write me a check for $26,950 from
    their&nbsp;own&nbsp;personal account, I would be more than
    happy to provide an additional&nbsp;chair for all
    cubicles.&nbsp;And no...you can not bring a chair from home
    either.</span><br>
    <span style=
    "font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">2)
    Coffepots, toasters, microwaves, refrigerators, etc are not to
    be&nbsp;used&nbsp;in the cubicles. Period, end of
    story.</span><br>
    <span style=
    "font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">3)
    Cubicle modifications - all modifications need to be approved
    by&nbsp;facilities. This is not your personal property and
    therefore is not&nbsp;yours&nbsp;to modify using nails, molley
    bolts, screws, saws, paint, etc.</span><br>
    <span style=
    "font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">4)
    Any of that old furniture that you became attached to
    (lamps,&nbsp;tables,&nbsp;bookcase, etc) is not approved for
    placement here. However, I'm told&nbsp;that&nbsp;you may be
    able to take it home (contact [name withheld]
    if&nbsp;interested).</span><br>
    <span style=
    "font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">If
    you have further questions or objections, please feel free to
    see&nbsp;me&nbsp;personally and I will help to
    explain.</span><br>
