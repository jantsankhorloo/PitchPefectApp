      With the upgrade moratorium lifted, and the need to furnish a
      new apartment, we've bought a few new home theater bits and
      integrated old home theater hardware from our storage unit.
      So now we've got a 47" LCD, BlueRay player, and surround
      sound. Overall it's great, but digital media restrictions
      threw an interesting twist into the setup.<br>

      We've had a home theater receiver and compact surround sound
      speakers in storage for almost 3+1/2 years. &nbsp;Last summer
      we listed these on <a href=
      "http://craigslist.com/">Craigslist</a>, along with a bunch
      of other household stuff we got rid of prior to our sailing
      cruise to Mexico. Since they weren't taking up much space, we
      ultimately decided to keep them, even though they've got a
      decade or so on them.<br>
      <br>
      The speakers aren't much of an issue, since they are analog
      devices compatible with any amplifier. The receiver, however,
      while having two digital inputs, does not support HDMI and
      all the onboard video switching is analog. What to do about
      this? Well I will argue there's really been a shift in home
      theater audio and video topology over the past 5 years. Where
      the home theater receiver used to be the hub of the network,
      now it's the TV - so basically instead of doing all the video
      and audio switching in the receiver, it's now done in the TV.
      This simplifies things in some ways, as you plug all your
      inputs to the TV, and all you need is one digital audio cable
      from the TV to the receiver. HDMI cabling makes it easy,
      since you just need one cable between devices for both video
      and audio. The devices communicate to establish and negotiate
      a compatible configuration. Pretty nifty!<br>
      <br>
      Super simple and great, right? Well, it would be - if digital
      media restrictions weren't an issue. In our case, our Toshiba
      HDTV will not output a Dolby Digital audio stream! The TV is
      perfectly cable of doing so, and there are setup options to
      do so, but it doesn't work. Why? Straight from the
      manual:<br>

      <blockquote>
        <i>The DIGITAL AUDIO OUT terminal may not output some
        digital audio sources because of copy restrictions.</i>
      </blockquote>Yep, that's right - our brand new HDTV has
      decided that we aren't worthy of getting the full digital
      audio stream that our DVD player and cable box are capable
      of!<br>
      <br>
      I don't care so much about the cable audio, but why have
      BlueRay and a great home theater setup when we are restricted
      to ProLogic surround? To get around this was simply a matter
      of running a separate digital audio output from the DVD
      player directly into the home theater receiver. And this
      means an additional step is required to playback a DVD in the
      best audio, as the receiver has to be switched to the
      input.<br>
      <br>
      And, as with most of these ridiculous digital media
      restrictions, it does absolutely nothing to prevent me from
      'stealing' the audio bitstream if so desired - as I can
      record directly off the DVDs digital audio output if I want
      to.<br>
      <br>
      Digital media rights and restrictions is a worthy topic for a
      future post, so I'll leave things there for now.<br>

      I'll write up specific product reviews for this stuff soon,
      as well as explain the other jumble of hardware sitting on
      the subwoofer in the picture, which includes a home telephone
      solution to replace Gizmo5, which
