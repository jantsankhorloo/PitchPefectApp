    I'm really surprised that Amazon and Barnes and Noble continue
    to push out eReader devices, and even more surprised that
    people are still buying them. Two or three years ago, it made a
    lot of sense, but it's 2012 now and if you want a new eReader,
    simply go buy <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_8gb">one of these for $199</a>:<br>
    <br>

    </div>I say this as the owner of two Nook products - an
    original first generation e-ink based reader, and a Nook
    Tablet.<br>
    <br>
    The reality is that a real Android tablet, like the Google
    Nexus 7 can do everything that the Kindle and Nook can - you
    can read all existing books from either device by installing
    the Kindle or Nook apps. And unlike the limited eReader
    tablets, a real Android tablet is... well... a real Android
    tablet so you have access to all the apps in Google Play, and
    full hardware features - such as a GPS and Bluetooth. For just
    an incremental additional cost you get a full blown
    tablet-based computing platform.<br>
    <br>
    The Kindle and Nook are very limited, as they only allow you to
    install applications from their very, very limited app stores.
    There are ways of hacking these devices to install regular
    Android apps (I did this on my Nook Tablet), but it's still a
    hack - and many applications are still not supported on the
    hardware - such as anything requiring a GPS.<br>
    <br>
    There's only one reason I can think of to buy a Kindle or Nook
    - if you really want an e-ink display for better viewing in
    direct sunlight, in which case it might make sense to buy one
    of the e-ink based models, but note that due to technical
    limitations of e-ink displays, these units don't have anywhere
    near the capabilities of models with LCD or OLED displays.<br>
    <br>
    And finally, yes - Apple is coming out with 7" tablet of their
    own, but it will come as no surprise that I wouldn't recommend
    it. It just doesn't make sense to pay twice as much for
    Apple's&nbsp;proprietary&nbsp;hardware and locked down
    ecosystem. It makes me laugh everytime someone tries to plug an
    Apple product into anything else, with all the ridiculous
    dongles required to convert from industry standard connectors
    to Apple's proprietary ones. Enough said about that - do
    yourself a favor and buy an Android based product. You'll thank
    me later!
