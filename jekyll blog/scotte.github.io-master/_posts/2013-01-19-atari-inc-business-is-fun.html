    If you are interested in the history of Atari, I would
    encourage you to grab a copy of "<b>Atari Inc. Business Is
    Fun</b>" by Curt Vendel and Marty Goldberg. This is a
    <b>big</b> book - 800 pages of narrative, pictures, and
    internal documents that tell the unabridged history of this
    pioneer video game company. What Atari was doing in the 70s and
    early 80s shaped not only the video game industry, but the
    entire computer industry.<br>
    <br>
    As an added bonus, there's even a picture of me in this book!
    My father was an engineer for Atari from the beginning until
    the fall of Atari in 1984.<br>
