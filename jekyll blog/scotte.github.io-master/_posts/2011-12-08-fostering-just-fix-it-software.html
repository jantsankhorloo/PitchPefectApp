  <div class='post'>
    During my career in software development I've encountered many
    different corporate cultures. A common one is what I like to
    call a "culture of blame". In blame cultures, everything
    revolves around finding someone else to blame. When a project
    is late, product managers blame developers. When there are
    bugs, developers blame QA. When tests fail, QA blames
    development. When there are production problems, operations
    blames developers. When QA can't get test environments to work,
    QA blames operations. When software is pushed before it's
    ready, developers blame product managers. It's all
    about&nbsp;plausible&nbsp;deniability and a "circle of
    blame".<br>

      Where I work now has a very different culture. I call it the
      "just fix it" culture. If you break the build,&nbsp;"just fix
      it". If tests fail,&nbsp;"just fix it". If there's a
      production issue,&nbsp;"just fix it". You see where this is
      going... Instead of finding someone to blame, or finding ways
      to defer the problem,&nbsp;"just fix it", and move on.
      There's no need for retrospectives (where everyone sits in a
      meeting room deciding who to blame), nor really any need to
      discuss it beyond what is required to fix it and get back on
      track.

      Whether it's a "culture of blame", or one of "fix it", the
      reality is that the same person has to fix it. By skipping
      all the crap in the middle, we go from problem to solution
      without delay and diversion. Instead of pretending that we
      can be perfect, the trick is to accept that things break.
      It's not that we want things to break, it's about accepting
      reality. The poor person didn't mean to break it - he or she
      is mortified about it, in fact. By accepting a "just fix it"
      culture, we just ask that they fix it, and move on. In a
      "culture of blame" we end up&nbsp;discouraging&nbsp;this
      person from being productive because blame is intimidating,
      and it scares people into being afraid to commit. When people
      are afraid to commit, they stop being productive.

      In the end, software development is all about productivity.
      You want developers to be productive. You want QA to be
      productive. You want operations to be (you guessed it)
      productive. How do we make everyone productive? It's not by
      pointing fingers, and it's not by assigning blame. We all
      know when we screw up, and we don't like doing so. Deep down
      inside, we all&nbsp;fundamentally&nbsp;want to succeed. This
      is pretty obvious, right? Nobody likes failure. So why do so
      many companies build a culture around failure instead of
      success? It's a good question, right?

      So what's the secret?

      Well, from the above, it's pretty obvious - stop playing the
      blame game. If Fred checks in code that breaks the build,
      Fred should know about it as soon as everyone else does. If
      he doesn't have visibility into this, then you need to
      improve your build system and notifications. It's perfectly
      OK to tell Fred "hey, did you see that the build failed?".
      Fred didn't plan on breaking it, and he wants to fix it.
      Notify, but don't blame. Fred will fix it. If Fred's not
      around, then someone else has to fix it. This is the exact
      same situation that you could be in with a "culture of blame"
      anyway, and the end result is the same, that somebody will
      need to fix it. Again, instead of worrying about who to
      blame, let's "just fix it", and move on.<br>
      <br>
      An agile release process is key as well. If you only release
      a few times a year (or less), then blame is more likely,
      because the release process is expensive and infrequent. We
      release every week. If your code isn't ready, then your code
      doesn't go out this week. It's that simple, and the worst
      case is your code ships the following week instead. Very
      rarely we have skipped a release because the release branch
      has had issues, but again we don't blame anyone - we "just
      fix it" and release a different day, instead. Having the
      ability to do rolling upgrades without bringing down the site
      is key.

      Simple, right?

      It is simple, but there's complexity in the details, and it
      requires discipline and support from management - and an
      acceptance that things do go wrong. And yes, it requires that
      your corporate culture change. Are you mature enough to
      handle it? That's all up to you!
