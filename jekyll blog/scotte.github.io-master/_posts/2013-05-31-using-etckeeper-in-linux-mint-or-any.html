    My systems tend to live for a long time with very frequent
    updates. By this, I mean that I don't reinstall the system, but
    continually upgrade the same Linux installation. While I apply
    upgrades to patches frequently (daily), this also applies to
    major distribution upgrades as well.<br>
    <br>
    Performing in-place distribution upgrades is easier in some
    distributions than others - as with most things in life there
    are tradeoffs, so distributions likes raw Debian, or LMDE
    (Linux Mint Debian Edition) are always rolling upgrades, but
    tend to lag far behind Ubuntu or other mainline distributions
    (Linux Mint, Arch, Gentoo etc). On the flip-side, there are
    distributions who strongly discourage doing in-place upgrades,
    recommending users back-up and restore the system for each
    upgrade.<br>
    <br>
    While Linux Mint is in that latter category, it's actually
    quite easy to do an in-place upgrade without losing anything.
    Although some people have reported issues doing so, I've never
    had any insurmountable issues with doing it. In fact, one of my
    computers last had a full install of Linux Mint 11, and is now
    running Linux Mint 15, having been upgraded each time.<br>
    <br>
    In fact, in some cases doing upgrades have given me greater
    stability and options than a fresh install, such as when there
    was a kernel 3.8 issue in Linux Mint 15 that would have
    prevented boot, but instead I was able to simply boot under an
    older 3.5 kernel from Linux Mint 14, which I used until a newer
    kernel was available with the issues fixed.<br>
    <br>
    Wait, isn't this a blog about <a href=
    "https://github.com/joeyh/etckeeper">etckeeper</a>? Oh, right!
    :-) All of the discussion above is a great reason for why you
    might want to keep your /etc configuration files under version
    control. As packages are upgraded, or as you change
    configurations over time, you can easily diff configurations.
    And if you do a reinstall type upgrade, you can save off your
    entire /etc directory along with the version history, for
    comparison.<br>
    <br>
    Whenever a package has an updated configuration file it's a bit
    less stressful to just answer "Yes, overwrite my customized
    configuration with the package maintainers version". Although
    it always saved back-up files previously, it wasn't always easy
    to find all the files related to a specific upgrade. With
    etckeeper, it's trivial - just diff the commits!<br>
    <br>
    Setting up etckeeper is easy, and in it's simplest form you
    don't have to manage it at all - as you apt-get (or use
    aptitude, or other higher level package manager utilities),
    your /etc configuration will be automatically versioned. I
    recommend <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>&nbsp;for the
    version control system (VCS), which is what is in the examples
    below.<br>

    <ul>
      <li>Install etckeeper (and git if you don't already have
      it):</li>
    </ul><br>
    <span style=

    sudo apt-get install git etckeeper&nbsp;</span><br>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>Update <b>/etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf</b>, commenting
        all VCS lines except <i><b>git</b></i>:</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>And finally, initialize the etckeeper
          repository:</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <span style="background-color: black;"><span style=
        "color: yellow; font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">
        &nbsp;</span><span style=
        "color: white; font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">$</span>
        <span style=
        "color: yellow; font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">
        sudo etckeeper init &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div>
        <span style="background-color: black;"><span style=
        "color: yellow; font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">
        &nbsp;</span><span style=
        "color: white; font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">$</span>
        <span style=
        "color: yellow; font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">
        sudo etckeeper commit "initial version"&nbsp;</span></span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>This will create an initial commit of all your
        configuration files as they are now.</li>
      </ul>For the simplest use-case, that's all there is to using
      etckeeper! Whenever you do any system changes through the
      apt-get package manager (directly or indirectly), etckeeper
      will automatically get executed to version your configuration
      files in /etc before and after any package changes are
      applied to your system.
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      You can also explicitly commit changes when you manual change
      configuration files, and use the <b>commit</b> command to
      track them. See the manpages and the <a href=
      "https://github.com/joeyh/etckeeper">etckeeper</a> site for
      more information.&nbsp;
    </div>

    <div>
      <br>
    </div>

    <div>
      And finally, because this just uses git under the covers, you
      can use git commands to diff versions, etc - just cd to /etc
      and use git as root.
    </div>
