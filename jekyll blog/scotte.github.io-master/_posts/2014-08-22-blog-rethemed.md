I really wasn't very happy with any of the existing Jekyll templates as far as getting
exactly the look I wanted, so I built my own from scratch using the awesome
[bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) library to handle much of the heavy lifting and
keep the layout mobile friendly.

It's designed to be clean and simple, and with modular templates to reduce the amount
of duplicated code.

You can [get it from github here](https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean). I'm still
tweaking various things about the theme - so remember to merge often. Pull requests
are welcome as always!

I'll be submitting it to the Jekyll themes project once I'm happy that it's in a stable
state.
