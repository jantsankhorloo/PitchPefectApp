      Apple recently announced an initiative and authoring tools to
      get school textbooks into their new iBook platform. This is a
      really bad thing for a couple of reasons.<br>
      <br>
      First of all, this is an enforced vendor lock in. In other
      words, Apple iPad will be supported, and nothing else. This
      is not unexpected by Apple, but it begs the question about
      Apple's real motives.<br>
      <br>
      Second, if you are thinking about authoring a textbook for
      this platform, read the fine text of the agreement. You are
      agreeing to give Apple exclusive rights to your book. Yes,
      exclusive means exactly what it sounds like - You are
      explicitly denied from publishing your work in any other way
      or medium!<br>
      If Apple really cared about education, they would be
      embracing open standards with an equal footing for anyone,
      and respecting author's rights. They could do this in a way
      that still makes them money, but instead have chosen to make
      sure that they are the only player. I'm really disappointed
      in how the media is touting how "great" this is without
      considering the downside.<br>
      <br>
      Yep, Apple is proving themselves to be the new Microsoft,
      time and time again. I will continue to support open
      platforms and open standards, and encourage everyone reading
      this to do likewise. Say no to vendor lock in and exclusive
      publishing agreements!
