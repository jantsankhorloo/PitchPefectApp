  <div class='post'>
    What a crazy news week! It's only Tuesday, and already we
    have:<br>
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li><b>AT&amp;T buying T-Mobile</b>. This is clearly a bad
      thing for everyone but AT&amp;T, as we will see prices go up
      - and now there will be only a single major GSM carrier in
      the USA.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Microsoft suing Barnes&amp;Noble, Foxconn, and
      Inventec for using Android</b>. I guess the old adage is
      apropos here: "Those that can do, those that can't sue".</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Apple suing Amazon for using the words "App
      Store"</b>. Apple said &nbsp;"We've asked Amazon not to copy
      the App Store name because it will confuse and mislead
      customers", so Apple basically thinks their customers are
      stupid?</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Iran claims to have built a flying saucer shaped drone
      called Zohal</b>, and accompanied the press release with a
      picture of the drone. The picture, not surprisingly, was a
      fake - as a Google image search proved it was from an old
      Sci-Fi movie.</li>
    </ul>I'm curious to see what will happen today, tomorrow, and
    the rest of the week. Oh, and I'm not bothering with links to
    any of the stories - you can find them easily enough <a href=
    "http://google.com/">right here</a> :-).
