  <h1>Hello, this is my blog</h1>
  <p>
This blog follows the
<a href="https://lauris.github.io/2014/08/14/blog-like-theres-nobody-reading/">blog like there's nobody reading</a>
philsophy. It's largely of collection of things I'm thinking of at the time, things to refer
to later, how-to articles written for forums and other places, or posts to pass along to
friends, family, and coworkers about various things. People do come across it on the
internet at large, and that's great - the <strong>Hello</strong> above is for you, thanks
for stumbling upon this page. :-)

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
I current work as a Senior Performance Architect for Netflix, working on very large scale
performance issues for one of the largest application deployments in the world - all running
in Amazon AWS. I get to write a lot of nifty tools for analyzing performance data and keep
my Linux skills sharp with the size of our Linux fleet. People talk about "web scale", I
work on "Netflix scale".
  </p>
  <p>
Prior to Netflix I worked for Okta as Lead Performance Engineer. As Okta was a start-up
when I joined, I did a very broad array of engineering tasks. In addition to working
on a variety of performance issues, I refactored code, rewrote the Ant build system into
Maven, and spent much time working on software architecture and engineering discipline.
  </p>
  <p>
Somewhere in here I took a 6 month sabbatical, sailing our Privilege 39 catamaran Jane 'O
to the Sea of Cortez in Mexico and back - spending weeks at a time completely unplugged while
anchored in the remote islands North of La Paz with no internet, no cell service, and not
enough electricity to run power-hungry devices like computers. You can read about
our trip <a href="http://svjaneo.com">at our blog here</a>. If you ever get a chance
to unplug for an extended period of time, you should do it. You'll come back a different
person.
  </p>
  <p>
I've also worked at Rearden Commerce, Amdocs (via DST Innovis acquisition, via US
Computer Services acquisition, which was formerly Cable Data), and IBM - all in the
software engineering field at some level, with a mix of performance engineering, systems
administration, software development, and networking.
  </p>
  <p>
I'm proud about the fact that my name isn't that uncommon - and as a result, a
search for my full name returns a ton of results that are not me. My favorites
are the obituaries - if any recruiters are reading this - one of those is me,
I'm dead. Sorry I can't come work for you.

  <h1>Hobbies</h1>
  <p>
I don't have too much time for hobbies these days, working in the high paced
Silicon Valley tech universe. We spend a lot of time and money keeping our catamaran
afloat. In what little free time I do have, I enjoy annoying coworkers with mutated
squashes and cucumbers from the garden and smoking meats.
  </p>
  <p>
It's still in the early prototype stages of development, but I am working on BBQ pit
monitoring software for the BBQ Guru Cyberq Wifi via my
<a href="https://github.com/scotte/pitmon">pitmon</a>
project.
  </p>
  <p>
I worked on reverse engineering the RL90 FSH archive format used by Raymarine
chartplotters in <a href="https://github.com/scotte/fsh2gpx">fsh2gpx</a> so I could
import all our tracks, routes, and waypoints from our Mexico trip into GPX. I haven't
touched this for a couple of years, unfortunately, but others have gotten much further
along with the format so hopefully it will be a supported format of GPSBabel in the near
future.
  </p>
  <p>
I enjoy sailing, and in addition to sailing around the San Francisco Bay and San
Joaquin/Sacramento River Delta, and our <a href="http://svjaneo.com">trip to Mexico</a>, helped a friend deliver his
Catalina 42 from
<a href="http://www.sailblogs.com/member/oneiladventure/">Hawaii to San Francisco</a>,
which was quite a trip (and you'll see we really enjoyed writing our daily log). I've also crewed for a couple of
deliveries for skippers-for-hire.

  <h1>Linux and Open Source</h1>
  <p>
Ever since my first encounter with UNIX in the early-80's, I've been a hard-core UNIX
user, working with everything from Edition 7, Ultrix, SVR4, AIX, IRIX, Digital Unix,
HPUX, Solaris, FreeBSD, Linux, and others I've long since forgotten.
  </p>
  <p>
Since the early 2000's I've run Linux on my desktop at home and at work (sometimes
violating corporiate policies). I currently run straight Debian systems - Debian
Wheezy is fantastic - and I use the i3 tiling window manager. I have a few systems
running Debian Jessie (Testing) as well - and yes, they are quite happily running with
systemd. In the end, the debate about systemd is silly and most of the people who
complain about it have never actually tried it - relying on FUD from people with an
axe to grind.
  </p>
  <p>
Ubuntu has done a good marketing job, but they are on the wrong path. Projects like
Linux Mint have done a decent job of de-Ubuntu'ing it - but when you really
sit right down and think about it, why not just use base Debian? Start without
the crap to begin with. It works - really! It's great!
  </p>
  <p>
I've contributed to many open source projects over the years and consider my career
to be largely enabled by it's existence (even though I've worked at companies that have
shunned it). I abhor software patents, and look forward to the day when closed, litigious,
ecosystems like Microsoft, Oracle, and Apple are dead.
 </p>
  <p>
I mentioned companies I worked for that were anti-open source. The worst of these
was DST, where a lawyer once told me "the only reason someone would give away software for
free is because they stole it from someone else". Yes, the corporate lawyer actually
truly believed that, and couldn't understand software as a hobby, or the altruistic
nature of open source driving technology and the industry forward. I guess when you
are in a profession with zero forward facing vision and where you bill the customer
for every staple... well you just can't get it.

  <h1>Contacting Me</h1>
  <p>
Before cancelling my LinkedIn account I received constant, annoying spam from recruiters.
As a result of that, and the spam problem in general, if you want to contact me, you'll
have to find your own way, just please don't be a recruiter. <strong>#netflixoss</strong> on freenode is
one way. <strong>BM-2cW8s8oYC3yyNGS8vfL4Tbcr7qnmZgGH1A</strong> is another way.
